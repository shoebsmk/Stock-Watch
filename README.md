# Stock-Watch

Designed an app that allows the user to display a sorted list (Recycler View) of selected/searched stocks 
with live prices and dynamically changing UI based on companyâ€™s stock value.

Implemented Offline caching, parsed multiple inter-related Restful API calls and a pull-down swipe-refresh feature.
